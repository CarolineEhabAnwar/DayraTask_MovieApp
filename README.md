# DayraTask_MovieApp
A movie app using React Native and Redux, submitted as a task for a job application in Dayra

Notes:
- There was an error that I couldn't resolve before the deadline which concerns the Redux states. They were always returned undefined. Therefore, I used other created methods instead until I read more about this error
- I don't own a Macbook at the moment and therefore I can't install it and test it on iOS systems
- I couldn't access the account information from the api as it mentioned that access was denied, therefore I couldn't use the favourites and my movies features from the API and had to implement a dummy data in the Async Storage instead. There were some problems while using it as it doesn't update in the realtime and some of the fetched data might be inaccurate.
- The user has to manually pass the poster path when he adds a new movie until further updates in the development of the application.

Thank you very much
